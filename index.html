        <p>Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio website. I'm Arnob, a beginner web developer who is on his way to becoming a professional. This space was created so that you can get a sense of me as a person and as a web developer. Here you will find examples of my work and an explanation of the logic behind different choices I've made while working on them. My main focus is front-end development, but I'm getting into back-end development too. Hope you like what you see and find it useful. Please leave your comments, feedback and criticism in my guestbook!</p>
